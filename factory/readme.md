# Factory Pattern

## Description
The Factory Pattern provides a way to create objects without specifying the exact class or object type. This pattern allows for the dynamic creation of objects based on user input or other conditions.

## Usage
Useful when:
- Creating different objects based on conditions
- When the object creation logic is complex or requires specific configurations

## Real-Life Example
In a UI library, you may want to create different UI elements like buttons, checkboxes, or text inputs based on user input.
