# Strategy Pattern
The Strategy Pattern defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It allows the algorithm to vary independently from the clients that use it.

## Usage
Used when:
- You need to switch between different behaviors or algorithms dynamically
- Various algorithms may be applied to solve a problem

## Real-Life Example
In an e-commerce system, you might have different payment strategies (PayPal, credit card, bank transfer), and the system can dynamically choose which to use based on user preference.
