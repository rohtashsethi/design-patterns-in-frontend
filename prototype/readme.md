# Prototype Pattern
The Prototype Pattern allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object, or "prototype," rather than creating objects from scratch. This pattern avoids the overhead of object creation and allows for cloning of complex objects without directly coupling the code to specific classes.

In JavaScript, this pattern is naturally supported due to its prototypal inheritance system. Objects inherit properties and methods directly from other objects (prototypes).

## Usage
Use the Prototype Pattern when:
- Object creation is costly or complex.
- You want to avoid creating an object from scratch, and cloning an existing object is more efficient.
- You want to share properties between many instances without creating them multiple times.

## Real-Life Example
Imagine an application for creating different types of vehicles (cars, trucks, motorcycles). Instead of creating each vehicle from scratch, you can use a base vehicle object (prototype) and clone it to create similar vehicles with slight variations.

Scenario: Vehicle Cloning System

In a vehicle rental system, you might have a base vehicle prototype and create new cars, trucks, or motorcycles by cloning this prototype and then customizing each cloned object as needed.

## Benefits:
- Efficiency: Object cloning is much faster than creating objects from scratch, especially for objects with complex properties or initialization logic.
- Customizability: After cloning an object, you can easily tweak or modify properties without affecting the original prototype.
- Memory Efficiency: Shared properties and methods between objects reduce memory consumption, as you don't need to duplicate large structures.
