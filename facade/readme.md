# Facade Pattern
The Facade Pattern provides a simplified interface to a complex system or library. It hides the complexities and exposes only the essential parts, making the API easier to use.

## Usage
Used for:
- Simplifying interactions with complex systems
- Providing a simple API over a complicated library or service

## Real-Life Example
A user interface library might need to fetch user data and posts from different APIs. The facade simplifies the calls and returns a unified response.
