# Module Pattern

## Description
The Module Pattern is used to create private and public encapsulation in JavaScript, helping organize code into logical units and reducing global scope pollution. It allows you to expose only the properties and methods you want, while keeping internal details hidden.

## Usage
This pattern is commonly used to:

- Encapsulate logic into modules
- Hide implementation details
- Expose only what is necessary

## Real-Life Example
For example, in a shopping cart system, you might want to encapsulate the logic for adding/removing items and exposing only the total number of items and the ability to interact with the cart.
