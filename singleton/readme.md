# Singleton Pattern

## Description
The Singleton Pattern restricts the instantiation of a class to one single instance and provides a global point of access to it. This ensures that only one instance of the class exists.

## Usage
Ideal for:
- Managing application-wide configurations
- Logging services
- Caching systems

## Real-Life Example
Consider an application configuration that needs to be available globally. Instead of creating multiple instances, a singleton ensures there is only one configuration object shared across the application.
