# Observer Pattern
## Description
The Observer Pattern defines a one-to-many relationship between objects, allowing one object (subject) to notify multiple observers when a state changes. It helps decouple parts of your application that need to respond to changes.

## Usage
Used in:
- Event systems
- Pub/Sub implementations
- Notification systems

## Real-Life Example
In a user login system, when a user logs in, various parts of the application (e.g., UI, logging, and analytics) need to react to the login event.
