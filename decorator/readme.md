# Decorator Pattern
The Decorator Pattern allows for behavior to be added to individual objects dynamically at runtime. It provides an alternative to subclassing by extending the functionality of an object.

## Usage
Used for:
- Adding new responsibilities to objects
- Extending an object's behavior without modifying its structure

## Real-Life Example
In a social media platform, you may want to dynamically add badges, roles, or privileges to a user's profile without altering the original object.
